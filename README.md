# Project Auth

This pair-programming project combines the frontend with the backend to make our first Full-stack application. It was developed by Linnea Isebrink, Lena Simma and Kara Howes.

The project goal was to build an accessible API with authentication to implement a registration.

## The problem

We learnt how to doubly-encrypt passwords and authenticate users by using accessTokens. We also created a frontend with a registration/sign-in form to allow the user to access restricted content. We learnt how to display error messages from the backend using Redux.

The Backend was built using Node.js, MongoDB and Mongoose. The Backend is hosetd on Heroku.
The Frontend was built using ReactJS, Redux and React Route and CSS.
